**[DEMO LINK](https://denzzlle171.github.io/react_todo-app-with-api/)

## Description

This project is a Todo application designed for task management. Developed as part of my learning journey, the project includes HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript. The application utilizes an API for interacting with tasks, providing users with features such as task creation, deletion, marking as completed, and batch deletion. Additionally, the app includes a filter option to display tasks based on their completion status.

Features:
Task Creation: Users can create new tasks by providing a title and details.

Task Deletion: Individual tasks can be deleted from the list.

Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed, indicating that they have been finished.

Batch Deletion: Multiple tasks can be selected and deleted simultaneously.

Filtering: Users can apply a filter to display either completed or uncompleted tasks, aiding in task organization.
